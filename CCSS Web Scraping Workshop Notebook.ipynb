While implicit waits are a solid technique and certainly important to be familiar with when using Selenium, I'd overall recommend using **explicit waits** over implicit waits when given the option between the two. Explicit waits employ both the specified pause time of implicit waits with the additional feature of designating conditions that Selenium will check whether they become satisfied after interacting with the web site. It therefore provides more information regarding what you're expecting to occur following interacting with the page beyond just placing a brief wait without any additional context. \n","\n","Explicit waits are conducted via the `WebDriverWait` class in combination with `expected_conditions` (commonly shortened to `EC`). The one-line adaption of our implicit wait code block via the `explicit_wait` function that follows below designates what the browser will need to locate before proceeding forward with collecting data from the second page. \n","\n","`EC.presence_of_element_located` specifies our web driver to pause until the titles of the phones on the second page are displayed on the website. The number you pass along with `WebDriverWait` sets the amount of time before raising an exception similar to implicit waits, but this time it's based on whether the expected condition is met within the updated website HTML. I often use `EC.element_to_be_clickable` as well to ensure that a new element is fully loaded for interaction as my expected condition parameter, while many more conditions are available [as listed here](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/api.html#module-selenium.webdriver.support.expected_conditions).

We first initiatize our web driver, connect to the e-commerce site URL, and take care of the cookie pop-up that would otherwise conflict with our page button clicks. We additionally create a data list to collect the record values for each product. \n","\n","The `pages_left` variable is designed to serve as a stopping condition so Selenium will know when we've reached the last page and it can therefore break out of the data collection portion of the function. The complete workflow of data collection is based on the condition of `pages_left` exisiting, where for each round of data scraping we subsequently reduce the value by one. The idea behind this approach is that you can change `pages_left` to represent the number of pages you'd like to collect data from as needed. \n","\n","The text associated with the `thumbnail` class parameter in the HTML contains the exact four data points for each record that we're interested in, so we use an XPath based on identifying the `thumbnail` attribute as our element finder. \n","\n","You'll also note that our clicking of the next arrow button and then explicit wait is conditioned on the `pages_left` parameter not being at 1.
